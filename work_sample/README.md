# Work Sample

The Work package is a **learning project management system**.

## Core Philosophy
It's **not** just task tracking - it's **intelligence accumulation through work execution**. Each task generates knowledge that informs future tasks, creating projects that get smarter as they progress.

## What Makes It Different
- **Dependency-driven workflow** - only shows work that's actually ready
- **Context evolution tracking** - captures how understanding changes through task lifecycle (pre/during/post)
- **Knowledge relationships** - maps how discoveries contradict assumptions, rules enhance patterns
- **Single source of truth** - `getProject()` gives complete project intelligence in one call
- **Minimal but complete** - 5 tables, 10 methods, maximum functionality

## The Learning Loop
1. **Plan task** → Surface relevant context from previous work
2. **Execute task** → Capture discoveries and obstacles
3. **Complete task** → Crystallize new rules and patterns
4. **Next task** → Benefits from accumulated wisdom

## Practical Impact
Instead of starting each task from scratch, you build on **cumulative project intelligence**. Failed approaches are remembered, successful patterns are reused, assumptions that prove wrong are flagged.

It's **project memory that actually works** - embedded in workflow, not stored separately.

**In essence**: A system that makes projects smarter over time by learning from their own execution.
