# Todo Sample

You'll need to install the `invokej` tool to run this sample. Use the -g flag to install globally. This will give you command line access via `invj`

The use `bun add import-global` and place the `todo sample/.rules` in your Zed project directory. Place `todo sample\tasks.js` there too.

Now you can ask the ai to read the .rule and add a todo!

Good luck!
